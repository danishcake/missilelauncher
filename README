This is a little project that uses a USB missile launcher (of the type sold 
at Play.com) and a Wiimote to give you a hotspot tracking missile launcher. 
You can also control it with the wiimote dpad.

Controls:
dpad: change angle
A:    switch to IR hotspot tracking
B:    FIRE!
+-:   Increase/decrease IR sensitivity


Building:
You will need boost, libusb, bluez, libbluetooth-dev and cmake installed. 

Assuming you are running Raspbian this should be relatively simple. You can 
just use the standard debian method to install the dependancies

From memory I think the commands are:

sudo apt-get install cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev libboost1.50-all-dev bluez libbluetooth-dev

Now you need to install wiiuse, the library used to interface with the 
Wiimote. This is not in the standard repositories, so we can't just apt-get it.
Instead the source is bundled in the wiiuse subfolder.

Navigate to the wiiuse folder, build it and install it

cd wiiuse
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

Now we need to build the missile launcher. This is also built with cmake,
so the routine is very similar. Go to the project root

cd ..
mkdir build
cmake ..
make

Now we can run it
cd missilelauncher
sudo ./missilelauncher


You need root to run it as we detach a kernel driver from the USB missile 
launcher in order to take control ourselves.

Voila, missile launcher. Have fun.
